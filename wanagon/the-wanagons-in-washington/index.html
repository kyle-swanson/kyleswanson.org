            <p>We've been bad about updating recently, but we've been through Glacier, Calgary, Banff, Jasper, Whistler, Squamish, Vancouver, Seattle, Olympic NP, and the Washington coastline since our last post!  I'm not going to try to cover everything, but I'll do a picture dump with some descriptions of the highlights!  We're also working on posts about the food (my favorite?), and the lessons learned along the way (and maybe some pictures from my sketchbook!), so watch out for those coming soon!</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-018.jpg" alt="">
Here's a picture of our "camp setup" showing off how happy we are to have solar panels!  We still haven't run out of power, no matter how many cameras and laptops we charge. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-002.jpg" alt="">
A shot from our hike up Bridger Bowl outside of Bozeman, MT <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/11774766_972166676168290_383080868_n.jpg" alt="">
When in Bozeman, eat bison burgers (with extra BBQ sauce!)?  And thanks to an old friend Drew for meeting up with us here to catch up! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-003.jpg" alt="">
We found some free camping by a hotsprings.  In hindsight, the 90ish degree weather wasn't hotspringing weather.  However, the adventure to find the fenced in hot spring was a good way to spend a morning. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/11128904_972169739501317_721488967_n.jpg" alt="">
We camped along this lake outside Glacier.  And we probably need to have an entire blog post titled "Places Kendra drinks her morning coffee" <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-019.jpg" alt="">
The Mount Brown Lookout in Glacier National Park.  We hiked 5.5 miles with 4000 feet of elevation gain to get here, which turned out to be quite steep! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-020.jpg" alt="">
A beautiful view of the Mount Brown Lookout trail <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-021.jpg" alt="">
And another one <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/11739681_972169896167968_1263298028_n.jpg" alt="">
And then some much deserved swimming in Lake Macdonald.  We also met Hannah right outside of Glacier and got to see where she's living as a river guide in West Glacier (it's beautiful, Hannah!). <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-022.jpg" alt="">
After a rest day, we hiked the 15 mile Highline trail in Glacier with beautiful views and a lot less elevation change!  That line you can see in the center of the hill is the trail. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-004.jpg" alt="">
A view from the trail <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/IMG_7620.JPG" alt="">
Our endpoint and lunchspot on the trail:  Glacier Chalet <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-026.jpg" alt="">
And with that we made it into Canada, found our friend Eric, ate some poutine, and watched the USA WIN THE WOMENS WORLD CUP!  We would apologize for the Canadian flag in the picture of our American celebration, but given that we were in the country that held the World Cup, we were just being extra patriotic. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-024.jpg" alt="">
Moraine Lake <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/20150703_131840_HDR.jpg" alt="">
A lot of our adventures with Eric were covered in the climbing post, but we also went on some non-climbing adventures.  Here's a hike that got shut down due to bear activity. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-025.jpg" alt="">
And here's a grizzly a little ways down the road!  We're now officially glad there was a closure. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/20150703_150846.jpg" alt="">
Went a little further away (how fast exactly can grizzly bears travel??) and hiked to "Picklejar lakes" in Kananaskis country.  Thanks for the photo of us Eric! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/20150703_154210.jpg" alt="">
We swam in the third picklejar lake.  It was a bit chilly.  That must be why I look like I'm celebrating.  Hopefully you didn't want to see Kyle's facial expression. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-005.jpg" alt="">
Eric went back to work and we headed up towards Jasper!  The glacial silt makes all the water a spectacular teal color! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-006.jpg" alt="">
More colorful water! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-007.jpg" alt="">
Taking time to watch the glaciers while on a hike near the Icefield Center in Jasper.  We had a bit of a hazy day, but we could still see a lot of glaciers in this area. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-001.jpg" alt="">
A glacially carved canyon, complete with waterfall! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-008.jpg" alt="">
We made it to the town of Jasper!  And then saw this while hanging out at a lake.  That plume is right near where we had just been that morning--we later found out that that whole area was evacuated along with the trail we were thinking of backpacking the next day. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-009.jpg" alt="">
The smoke was an adventure, but since Riley was able to find us in Jasper we had an adventure buddy for a smoky night and morning! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-010.jpg" alt="">
We found a smoky and beautiful Mt. Robson (which I had been reading about in a mountaineering book, what are the chances!) <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-011.jpg" alt="">
And we spent a very fun and rainy day touring Whistler village.  Glad we remembered those rain jackets! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-012.jpg" alt="">
A lake close to Whistler <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-013.jpg" alt="">
And we were off to Squamish!  We hiked and climbed in the area for two days.  The climbing hear is very fun with a lot of cracks to climb-something I hope to one day be much better at! <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-014.jpg" alt="">
And then onto Vancouver.  I got Kyle hooked on Harry Potter!  So we have a never ending saga of finding the next one, which often brings us to some out of the ordinary bookstores. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/FE7C8AD6-5015-4638-86C0-9E68FC58BE40.GIF" alt="">
While in Vancounver, we stumbled upon the setup for the Gastown Grand Prix bike race, so we hung around the city a little longer and watched part of it. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/11756678_972170216167936_940320651_n.jpg" alt="">
While waiting for the bike race to start, we found the stadium that the US Women's soccer team won the final game of the World Cup at a little over a week before. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-016.jpg" alt="">
AND WE MADE IT BACK TO THE USA!! We had a quick stop in Seattle, and then it was off to Olympic National Park. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/resized-017.jpg" alt="">
One of my favorite things about road trips is the flexibility we have.  On our way up the Olympic peninsula, we saw signs for a lavender festival and decided that was a good place to stretch our legs and get out of the car for a little while. <br>
<img src="../content/images/2015/07/11774615_972178182833806_1291396608_n--1-.jpg" alt="">
And a quick shot of me being a tourist in a tree in the rainforest to end this post.</p>
